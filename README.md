# OwnaLoader2020


### Overview

This DLL injector was originally released in 2004 in a VC++ 6 workspace. I found this source code on one of my old 20GB external hard drives (lol), so I am trying to modernize it, make a few small improvements and give it a home on github.

### Original README:
Released on 12/25/04 (Merry Christmas!)

Pre-compiled for CS:S

Special thanks to:
- SpuN for releasing his loader code
- Tim for creating the graphics
- DeviatioN for bringing to my attention the memory leak
- MSDN
- Game-deception forums

Features:
- Minimize to tray
- Stays open so don't have to reload it each time you restart your game

If you want to use this loader for another game, simply change szTarget and recompile the loader.

Enjoy
